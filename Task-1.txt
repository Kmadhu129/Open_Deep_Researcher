LLM means “Large Language Model.”

A Large Language Model is an AI system trained on huge amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.



LLMs work on:

1. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

LLMs are built using deep neural networks, especially Transformer architecture.

2. Huge Amount of Data

They learn patterns from massive datasets:

Books

Websites

Articles

Code

Conversations

3. Tokenization

Text is converted into tokens (small word pieces) so the model can understand and process it.

4. Mathematics & Probability

LLMs use math to predict the next word/token.

They generate answers by choosing the most likely next token.

5. GPU/TPU Hardware

Training LLMs requires very powerful computers:

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)

TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)

6. Transformer Architecture

This includes:

Attention mechanism → helps model focus on important words

Self-attention layers → understand relationships between all words in a sentence



Types of LLMs

LLMs can be grouped in different ways. Below are the main categories:

1. Based on Model Architecture
a) Encoder-only Models

Good for understanding tasks

Examples:

BERT

RoBERTa

DistilBERT

b) Decoder-only Models

Good for text generation

Most chatbots use this type

Examples:

GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-5

LLaMA

Mistral

Falcon

c) Encoder–Decoder Models

Good for translation, summarization, Q&A

Examples:

T5

BART

FLAN-T5

2. Based on Size
a) Small LLMs

< 1B parameters

Fast, lightweight

Examples: TinyLLaMA, Gemma 2B

b) Medium LLMs

1B – 30B parameters

Balanced performance

Examples: LLaMA 3 (8B, 12B, etc.)

c) Large LLMs

30B+ parameters

High performance

Examples: GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude 3, Gemini Ultra

3. Based on Availability
a) Open-source LLMs

Free to use, modify

Examples:

LLaMA

Mistral

Falcon

Gemma (Google)

b) Closed-source LLMs

Proprietary

Examples:

GPT-4, GPT-5

Gemini Ultra

Claude

4. Based on Use Case
a) General-purpose LLMs

Chatting, reasoning, coding

Examples: GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA

b) Domain-specific LLMs

Trained for specific industries

Examples:

MedPaLM (medical)

FinGPT (finance)

LawGPT (legal)


Simple Workflow of ChatGPT


1. User Gives Input

You type a question, message, or instruction.

Example: “Explain OS concepts”

2. Input is Converted to Tokens

Your text is broken into small pieces called tokens.

Tokens help the model understand meaning properly.

3. Model Processes the Input

The model reads your tokens.

It checks patterns it learned during training.

It looks at:

Context (previous messages)

Meaning of words

Relationships between words

4. Model Predicts the Best Next Tokens

ChatGPT does NOT “think”; it predicts the next best token.

It generates word-by-word (token-by-token).

5. Output Tokens Combined into Text

The predicted tokens form sentences.

Those sentences become your final answer.

6. Response Sent Back to User

The output text is shown to you as ChatGPT’s reply.
